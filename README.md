**Introduction**

Teenagers today are far from what they were in the past couple of generations. They have more freedom to do what they want at a certain limit set by their parents or their own consciousness. According to the statement of Diana Divecha (2017), she speculated that compared to the teens of the previous generations, the teens of this generation are a lot closer to their parents leading to a better bond and lax parenting. With this in their minds, teenagers are more likely to focus on living their life to the fullest while they are young and free from life’s responsibilities. Staying away from the thought of their life being rigged against them since their lives are dictated by unequal income which is demoralizing and can possibly destroy the hope of having the freedom to choose of what their future can be.

As they are focused on enjoying their youth, some seek to do things that they are not supposed to do because they enjoy the thrill of it. This can be explained through Nadal-Vicens and Beresin’s statement that an adolescent brain is neurobiologically wired to seek thrill and impulsive decisions. While other teens go for adventurous things like breaking rules and disobeying their parents, some like copying the adults around them who indulge themselves with smoking, drugs, and sexual activities. One of the main addictions affected by peer pressure is sex, especially for males since they believe that losing their virginity is a sign of being a man. This has caused a lot of teenagers to perform pre-marital sex without a speck of knowledge on how to do it safely. Jane Shin Park (2010) has stated from her observations that sex has been prevalent among teens causing them to think less of the consequences that come along with it and more on how much pleasure they can achieve from it. This ignorance can also escalate due to the widespread of sexual materials on all types of media easily accessible to everyone which focuses on the entertainment of the audience and in turn, gives false expectations on sex. Teenagers will assume that sex is all fun and pleasure just like the sexual materials that they are exposed to. This can lead to accidents such as unplanned pregnancies and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD’s) wherein according to an article by Rowence Zorilla (2021) published on the National Nutrition Council website, “Early pregnancy is one of the pressing issues Filipino youths are facing today”. This problem can also stem from the parents’ unwillingness to teach their own children about sex during their early stages of life. Kim Thurler (2019) discussed that parents talking about sensitive topics such as sex with their teens makes them uncomfortable even though there are studies that keep on showing that children who receive proper sex education from multiple sources tend to have healthier relationships and lower rates of early pregnancy, STD infections, and sexual abuse.

So, after a 14 year wait, the Philippines has responded with the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (RH Act) as stated by Zoë Nichols (2020). Sex education has finally been integrated into public school curriculums for students ranging from ages 10 to 19. Through the act, it also funded health centers and public schools with free or subsidized contraceptives. But not everything went according to plan as majority of the Philippine citizens are Roman Catholics boasting with an 80% lead. Basically, it means that the Catholic Church had a huge influence on the state of sex education in the country. They believed that sex education will increase sexual relations in which they fear as it goes against their belief of sex being only for a married man and woman. According to a BBC News article from 2010, Senior bishops believe that the responsibility of telling children about these sensitive topics should be put on the parents and not on the teachers. They believe that if teaching sex education could have unintended consequences. It is apparent that high ranking church officials are not fully informed of the benefits of the implementation of sex education. Their decisions are merely linear and is influenced only because it goes against their beliefs. But according to Pat Aboagyewaa (2013), one of the leading factors that affects the high rate of teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortion is the lack of sex education in schools. With the difficulty of its implementation, sex education has been uncertain and lacking which still leads to what it aimed to prevent, teenage pregnancy and STD’s.

According to an article by the Dissertations expert (n,d), the education of South African students are affected by teenage pregnancy in which it will be halted as pregnancy issues will lead to poor academic performance, school absenteeism before they become school dropouts. It is also observed that their education level will remain low as most of these girls seldomly return to continue their education. This can negatively affect the economy along with another possible family in poverty due to the lack of support from their families. It is stated in the study of Louse Gailled (2016) that teen mothers are less likely to complete their high school education and very much likely not to complete their college education. This easily puts them at a disadvantage at finding a job that can support the needs of their family. Even with multiple low wage jobs, the child would probably be malnourished as its parents’ income would not suffice.

**Problem Statement**

The main objective of this study is to analyze the teenage pregnancy rate of 2012-2019. It aims to determine the following:

1. The number of teenage pregnacies from 2012-2019.
2. Their knowledge about the use of contraceptives.
3. Usage rate of contraceptives.
4. Education level in which sex education should begin.

**Significance of the proposed project**

Teenagers – this study helps inform them of the risks of being ignorant when it comes to sex where they are not openly taught by their parents about it.

Parents – parents are the models of their children and their guide, with this study, they will learn that it is better to teach them as early as possible about the responsibilities that comes with sex.

Students – this study can be utilized by the students as a reference for their own studies and as a way of learning the importance of knowledge.

Government – this study discusses how early teenage pregnancy can affect the economy therefore leading to a serious and strict implementation of sex education.

Community – this study can help inform the community about the situation of surrounding teenage pregnancy. It can also help in the success of the implementation if the stigma of teenage sex can be removed.

**Methods**

The researchers used the data sets provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to analyze the age group of teenage pregnancies in the Philippines. Examination of the data sets will be the first step. The examined data sets will then provide data that answers the problem statement through comparisons.  With the gathered information, a scenario analysis was executed to identify the actions needed to be taken in order to properly handle teenage pregnancy.

**Expected output**

The goal of this study is to spread information about teenage pregnancy through analyzed data and how sex education can actually improve the economic state of the Philippines. As teenage pregnancy can lead to a lot of life-changing crisis that is one of the main reasons why the Philippines has one huge problem with poverty. Having a baby early can affect the well-being and financial status of the parents, which can lead to the abandonment of the teenagers along with the baby and adding another struggling family to the population.

This study is expected to remove the stigma surrounding sex education. That having an open mind about sex is safer for the future than having a closed mind with inherited values that makes people seek the unknown in secrecy.

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the Project**

The SDG that this project aims to attain is No Poverty and Good Health and Well-Being.

Goal 1: No Poverty – intends to reduce the poverty rates by lessening the number of struggling families made through early pregnancy and overpopulation.
